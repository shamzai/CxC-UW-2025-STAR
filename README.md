#📊 CxC UW Datathon Reports (2025)
This repository contains reports from the CxC UW 2025 Datathon, where we tackled real-world data challenges using data science and machine learning techniques. The reports document our methodology, analysis, and key findings for three challenges: SAP Sustainability & Multidimensional Poverty Index, TouchBistro Restaurant Analytics, and Federato RiskOps User Engagement.

#📂 Reports Overview
##1️⃣ SAP Sustainability & Multidimensional Poverty Index
Objective: Develop a Multidimensional Poverty Index (MPI) to rank countries based on education, health, and living standards.

Techniques Used: PCA, Random Forest, Clustering (K-Means)
Key Insights: Access to clean cooking fuels emerged as the most influential poverty factor.
Policy Recommendations: Focus on clean energy initiatives and targeted interventions for poverty alleviation.
